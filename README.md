# Salesforce

This file contains code snippet for the developers who are working as Salesforce Developer.

I am trying to build a library which can be used by the Devs for quick suggestions. 

Please find my below code snippents in the repo.

1. Trigger [ One Object one Trigger Rule. This is very basic for small project. ]
2. Aura
3. LWC
4. VF Page [Coming Soon]


NOTE: Create a PR if you think there can be an improvement in the code. I will surely check and merge the details.
